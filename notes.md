App.js -> main component
One way Data Flow (Only from parent component to children)
Props -> Data which can be passed from parent to child element. 
State -> Javascript object which contains the data that we need to render on screen but it can change with time.
To transfer data between sibling components, we can use callback methods to transfer data from child to parent and once that
method is invoked, we can again transfer from parent to child(the other sibling).
